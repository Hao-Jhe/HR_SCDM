   Parametrization of the ozone photochemistry for use in 3D atmospheric models
   Version 2
   June 2007
   Author: D. Cariolle
 *********************************************
 The ozone tendency is equal to:

      d r
      ---  =     < P - L > +
      dt
                d (P - L)
              < --------- > ( r - < r > ) +
                   d r

                d (P - L)
              < --------- > ( T - < T > ) +
                   d T

                d (P - L)
              < --------- > ( S - < S > ) +
                   d S

                   R_Het     r

     with  r : volumic ozone mixing ratio
           T : temperature
           S : ozone column above a point
           P : photochemical production of ozone
           L : photochemical destruction of ozone
           R_Het : photochemical destruction of ozone due to heterogeneous chemistry

    Terms between < > denote two-dimensional variables obtained at
    equilibrium from the MOBIDIC 2D photochemical model. Other terms are
    three-dimensional variables generated by the 3D Circulation Model.


    coefficient A1 : < P - L >       units : s-1

                      d (P - L)
    coefficient A2 : < --------- >   units : s-1
                         d r

    coefficient A3 : < r >           units : none (volume mixing ratio)

                      d (P - L)
    coefficient A4 : < --------- >   units : s-1 K-1
                         d T

    coefficient A5 : < T >           units : K

                      d (P - L)
    coefficient A6 : < --------- >   units : cm2 molecule-1 s-1
                         d S

    coefficient A7 : < S >           units : molecule cm-2
 
    coefficient A8 : R_Het           units : s-1 (to be used only if T<195K during daytime at high latitude)

This parameterization is described by Cariolle et al., 1986 (version 1) and the present version 2 by Cariolle and Teyss重re (2007).
Version 2 has been improved over version 1 with an update version of the MOBIDIC model. Major changes concern:
- the use of JPL Publication 02-25 2003 for chemical rates in MOBIDIC.
- the residual circulation to force MOBIDIC is obtained from a scenario calculation of the Arpege/Climat model.
- the heterogeneous chemistry is parameterized using an additional ozone destruction term: A8 * r 
  representative of year 2000 with 3.8 ppbv total chlorine in the upper stratosphere. If the parameterization is used
  for other periods with a different total chlorine content Clx, the A8 term must be replaced by: A8 * (Clx/3.8)**2, 
  the destruction rates being a quadratic function of Clx. In addition the A8 term must be used only if T<195K 
  and during daytime (for solar zenith angles lower than 87 ｡) at high latitude (over 45｡ latitude).

The major improvements of version 2 over the version 1 are a reduction of a negative bias in the ozone content 
in the middle stratosphere (around 10-30 hPa) at low and mid latitudes (compared to HALOE and SAGE data), a reduction 
of a positive bias in the ozone content in the troposphere and a total ozone content in very good agreement with 
the TOMS data all year around.

In addition, the version 2 can be used with a cold tracer formulation for calculation of the heterogeneous chemistry (see Cariolle
and Teyss重re, 2007). The coefficient A9 gives the cold tracer decay rate (Units: s-1).

The attached files (COEFOZ_v2.x.ascii; COEFOZ_read.f) contain the A coefficients (9 coefficients by month) and
a fortran program to read them.

The users of the parameterization are requested to give reference to Cariolle and al., 1986 and/or Cariolle and Teyss重re (2007) in 
any publication of results obtained using this paramaterization, and to refer to the authors in case of problems encountered 
in implementation or use.
