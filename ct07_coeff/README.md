Origional coefficients for ozone scheme (Cariolle & Teyssedre, 2007) provided by Daniel Cariolle.

"A1.nc-A9.nc"

Input coefficient files for ozone scheme in the SCDM. The relaxation ozone profile A3.nc and temperature profile A5.nc are replaced by 3-dimensional MERRA2 ozone climatology (A3_MERRA2_O3_1980_2018.nc) and temperature climatology (A5_MERRA2_T_1980_2018.nc). 

"INPUT_MERRA2_ALBEDO_1980_2018.nc"

Input surface albedo from MERRA2 climatology for shortwave ozone heating parameterization method.
